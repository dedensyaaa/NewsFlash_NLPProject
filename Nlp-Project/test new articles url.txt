TALISAY City Mayor Gerald Anthony “Samsam” Gullas Jr., an avid sportsman, has announced the resumption of his massive grassroots program designed to get more kids to adopt an active lifestyle and to discover potential athletes among Talisay City residents.

“Our Talisay Summer Sports Clinic started last 2022 after the pandemic. We always believed that conducting a summer sports clinic will have a positive impact on our youth because it will give them a chance to socialize with other children after being on lock down through the camaraderie of sports,” said Gullas.

This year, Talisay City will be offering free clinics for taekwondo, arnis, athletics, modern dance, dancesports, basketball, volleyball, swimming, karatedo, table tennis, badminton, football, boxing, chess, and sepak takraw. It will also offer arts, guitar, and voice lessons.

To make sure more kids can join the clinic, the Talisay City Sports Commission will have three batches for this year’s clinic.

“We feel this is important because instead of staying at home, watching TV, browsing the internet, and scrolling on their phones or tables, it is better to engage them in activities like this where they can exercise, learn new skills, and make new friends,” said Gullas.

Gullas said when they started the clinic in 2022, they had 1,233 participants and in 2023, the number grew to 2,012 and he is hoping to have more kids join this year.

“We also created this program to nurture the talents of our Talisaynon children and help them reach their full potential in sports,” he said. / ML

Breakthrough in Renewable Energy: Solar Power Efficiency Doubles

In a groundbreaking development, researchers at the National Institute of Renewable Energy have successfully doubled the efficiency of solar panels. This revolutionary advancement is set to significantly impact the renewable energy sector, potentially reducing the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

The research team, led by Dr. John Smith, developed a new type of photovoltaic cell that can convert sunlight into electricity with an unprecedented efficiency rate of 45%. This is a substantial increase from the current average of around 20%.

"This breakthrough represents a major step forward in our quest for sustainable energy solutions," Dr. Smith stated during a press conference. "Our new technology has the potential to transform the global energy landscape, making solar power a more viable and cost-effective option for everyone."

The enhanced solar panels utilize a novel material called perovskite, which has shown remarkable efficiency in absorbing sunlight and converting it into electrical energy. The team has spent the last five years refining the production process to ensure the material is both durable and affordable for mass production.

Industry experts have hailed this innovation as a game-changer. "This could be the tipping point for renewable energy adoption," commented Maria Lopez, an energy analyst at Green Future Solutions. "The increased efficiency means that we can generate more power from smaller installations, reducing both the cost and the space required for solar farms."

The next steps for the research team include scaling up production and conducting field tests to evaluate the long-term performance of the new solar panels in various environmental conditions. They are optimistic that these panels will be available for commercial use within the next two years.

This development comes at a crucial time as the world grapples with the challenges of climate change and the urgent need to transition to cleaner energy sources. With this breakthrough, solar power could play a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions and fostering a more sustainable future.
